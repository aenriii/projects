# Project Name

This folder/page serves as a format example for any project i have. There's
frontmatter up at the top that I can use to query projects for when i
eventually integrate this with my website. This area will serve as a
description/tagline area, what's here will serve as a description for the
project.

## The rest of the page

As for the rest of the page, when you click or tap on a project
(*eventually*) you'll be shown a large modal containing rendered contents of
this page. Often, this'll include things like a more apt description of the
the project, a few how-tos and maybe a getting started item for some things,
for projects like libaenri it'll end up showing how to get started with using
the api for yourself as well as instructions on how to selfhost an instance and
how to give libaenri all the permissions it needs on all services it needs.
